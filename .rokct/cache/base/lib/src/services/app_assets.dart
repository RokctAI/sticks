/// today that is the brand logo, referenced by auth's login page and the
/// marketplace home. Everything else is SDK-owned: an SDK declares its
/// constants under `asset_keys` in its manifest and the installer injects
/// them between the markers below at compose time (the exact tr_keys
/// model), while the FILES arrive via the SDK's own `installs` template
/// entries. The pre-split marketplace constants (card logos, shop
/// banners, food imagery) lived here for the generic marketplace template
/// heritage; the ones still shipped now belong to the marketplace SDK.
