/// Standing rule (decision-log entry 56): a student sees only a friendly
/// line; the real cause — the verbatim server/exception detail plus status
/// code — goes to admins through the one telemetry door ([TelemetryClient],
/// backend `log_frontend_error` pipeline).
///
/// This is the fleet-general promotion of auth_sdk's `AuthErrorPresenter`
/// (users repo, PR #36), which itself generalised two compliant patterns
/// from the agent repo:
///
///  * the assistant-chat pattern (assistant_service.dart):
///    `TelemetryClient.I.logError(type: ..., context: {status_code,
///    server_message, ...})`, then only a friendly line on screen;
///  * the homework refusal split (http_homework_repository.dart):
///    a server reply whose copy is authored for the student is shown
///    verbatim; every other failure is technical detail for telemetry.
///
/// It is the documented partner of `NetworkHelpers.errorHandler`: that
/// helper extracts the raw (admin-grade) detail string, and this class
/// decides what the person at the screen is allowed to see — either a
/// server-authored 4xx line meant for them, or a friendly translated
/// fallback while the detail rides to telemetry. Student-facing surfaces
/// should reach it through `NetworkHelpers.friendlyErrorHandler` (string
/// producing) or [show]/[showTechnical] (snackbar producing); admin
/// surfaces may keep consuming the raw `errorHandler` string directly.
