/// backend-served values always win (the app keeps using them via the
/// existing splash fetch).
///
/// Candidate rows are:
///  * the active locale's bundled entries whose keys the just-fetched
///    served map does not contain (the served map is for the active
///    locale, so this is the only locale that can be diffed locally), and
///  * an `en` row for every key registered in any bundled locale, valued
///    with the bundled `en` entry when one is registered (the kernel's
///    own map plus whatever the composed SDKs registered at boot) and
///    otherwise humanized with [AppHelpers.humanizeTrKey] — in both cases
///    the exact string the UI renders for the key when the served map
///    lacks it. These are sent without local diffing (except when `en`
///    IS the active locale); the server's insert-only skip makes
///    over-sending harmless.
///
/// The push is fire-and-forget: it never blocks splash and never surfaces
/// anything to the user. A fingerprint of the candidate set (rows + app
/// version) is persisted only after a fully successful push, so a failed
/// attempt retries naturally on the next launch and an unchanged app
