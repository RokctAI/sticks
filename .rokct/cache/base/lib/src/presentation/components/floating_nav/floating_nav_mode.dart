/// WHAT THE FLOATING PILL IS CURRENTLY SHOWING.
///
/// The pill has one look and one owner (base_sdk), but three jobs:
///
///  1. the root tab bar — [FloatingNavTabsMode], the original and default;
///  2. in-session controls while a lesson plays (reactions / mic / video /
///     chat) — [FloatingNavControlsMode], supplied by lms_sdk;
///  3. call controls once telephony_sdk has screens — the SAME
///     [FloatingNavControlsMode] with a different action list (more,
///     video, speaker, mute, and a red hang-up).
///
/// Case 3 is why this is a mode object rather than a pile of optional
/// parameters: telephony hands over a list of buttons and gets the app's
/// bar, without importing lms_sdk, without a second widget, and without
/// this component learning what a lesson or a call is (ADR-005 — the pill
/// renders what it is given and reports taps back; meaning lives in the
/// feature SDK).
///
/// The mode is PASSED DOWN by whichever page is on screen, exactly like
/// [FloatingNavTabsMode.currentIndex] already is. Deliberately not stored
/// in a provider: a stored mode has to be restored on every exit path
/// (back button, system back, a route replaced out from under the page),
/// and any missed path leaves the tab bar stuck showing mic-and-reactions
/// on the schedule. Passing it down cannot get stuck — the page that isn't
/// on screen isn't drawing a bar.
