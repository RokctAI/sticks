/// Orientation is DECLARED, never taken. The app pins portrait on phones
/// only ([shouldLockPortrait] — the single copy of that rule); a page that
/// genuinely wants to turn with the device says so by wrapping itself in a
/// [FreeRotation], and base honours the claim while that page is mounted
/// and puts the app's own policy back the moment it goes away.
///
/// The point is that a page never calls [SystemChrome] itself: ownership
/// never leaves base, so there is no restore for a page to forget and no
/// second copy of the phone/tablet rule to drift. It is the same shape as
/// the plane claim in `planes.dart` — the page declares what it needs, the
/// host arbitrates — but it deliberately rides on the widget tree rather
/// than on `PlanePage`, because the pages that need it most (radio, which
/// is the fleet's no-planes carve-out) sit outside the plane host
