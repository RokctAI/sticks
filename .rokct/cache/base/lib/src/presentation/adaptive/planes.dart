/// The plane mechanism (the approved plane proposal, frame 1c).
///
/// A wide window is divided into 1, 2, or 3 EQUAL-WIDTH PLANES by real
/// logical width — the same Material 3 breakpoints as [AppBreakpoints]:
/// phones (< 600) get one plane, unfolded folding phones (600..839) two,
/// tablet/desktop windows (>= 840) three. The user's page flow is then
/// WINDOWED onto those planes: instead of each step covering the screen
/// (the phone model), the newest steps of the flow sit side by side, the
/// deepest step in the LAST plane.
///
/// Importance is DECLARED and DYNAMIC. A page declares its claim in
/// planes ([PlanePage.span] — "I'm important, give me two", or
/// "give me a second one only if it would otherwise sit empty"); the claim of
/// the ACTIVE page (the flow's newest step) always wins at that moment,
/// and earlier pages YIELD by compressing: the page just under the active
/// step keeps whatever planes remain (up to its own claim) and re-spreads
/// onto them — a spread profile yields one plane to an arriving page and
/// compresses from three columns to two — then the next page outward,
/// until planes run out and the rest slide off. Navigating deeper
/// replaces the last plane's content; BACK pops the newest step and the
/// planes it held return to the pages beneath (back restores). A claim is
/// counted in planes and is never demoted while planes exist: asking for
/// at least as many planes as the screen has means the full screen. On a
/// one-plane (phone) screen every page renders its phone layout — the
/// mechanism disappears by construction.
///
/// Sheets and dialogs never take planes — they overlay, exactly as on
/// the phone.
