/// The routed `/generic-profile` page: [GenericProfilePage] on planes.
///
/// [GenericProfilePage] spreads only under a [PlaneHost] (the approved
/// plane proposal, frame 1c, capped at two planes by the 4c ruling); on
/// an ordinary route it renders its phone list, which a wide window
/// simply stretches. Every composed app mounts the page through the
/// `/generic-profile` route in base_sdk's own route shell, so the host
/// lives HERE, once — no shell needs a wrapper of its own.
///
/// At plane widths (two or more planes, [PlaneHost.planeCountFor]) the
/// page sits in a [PlaneHost] whose root is the profile, declared
/// [PlaneSpan.two] — the universal profile cap: two planes at most — and,
/// because the routed profile is a PUSHED page (`pushGenericProfileRoute`),
/// it carries the pushed page's one back: the [FloatingBackPill] at the
/// bottom-END corner, exactly where [PlaneHost] parks its own pill (frame
/// 1d; "back button should always be at a corner"). The pill shows only
/// while there is somewhere to go back to, so a composition that opens on
/// the profile never draws a dead back.
///
/// The host's DETAIL PLANE (Ray 2026-09-07, "on a tablet the generic
/// profile host must not leave the third plane empty"): a section that
/// declares a [ProfileSection.detailBuilder] opens IN the host — its
/// detail is pushed onto the plane stack as the active step with the
/// default one-plane claim, so it takes the LAST plane and the profile
/// yields but keeps spreading over the two before it (three planes), or
/// compresses to its phone layout beside the detail (two planes). Cards
/// reach this through [ProfileSectionNavigator.open]. On a THREE-plane
/// screen the registry's [ProfileSectionRegistry.defaultSectionId] is
/// open from the first frame, so the profile lands with its third plane
/// filled; another section's detail replaces it, and the corner pill
/// returns to the default before it pops the route. On two planes nothing
/// is seeded — the profile keeps both planes until a card opens a detail.
/// A detail with no hub card — the edit-profile form the registry's
/// [ProfileSectionRegistry.editProfileDetailBuilder] supplies, opened by
/// the identity-card pencil or [ProfileSectionNavigator.openEditProfile]
/// — takes the same plane the same way, and the same pill returns from it;
/// the detail itself may leave through [ProfileSectionNavigator.close]
/// (a saved form), which is the pill's first step without the tap.
///
/// When there is NO detail to seed — no
/// [ProfileSectionRegistry.defaultSectionId], or no section registered at
/// all — the ruling still holds, so the profile is the whole flow and
/// presents on its OWN planes ([PlanePage.allowNeighbors] false). The host
/// then clamps the window to the two planes the profile's claim holds and
/// those two share the full width: the universal cap is kept exactly (two
/// planes, two columns) and no stage is left bare. The flag is read only
/// for the ACTIVE step, so it does nothing at all while a detail is open —
/// the profile then yields the last plane and spreads over the two before
/// it, precisely as before.
///
/// On a phone (one plane) the page is [GenericProfilePage] — no host, no
/// seam; every card pushes the route it always did. When the route was
/// PUSHED (something to go back to) it carries the floating nav's
/// back-only pill at the bottom, like every other pushed page; a root
/// profile draws none.
