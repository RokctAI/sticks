/// Pill badge showing how often the signed-in user opened the app in
/// ONE period — this ISO week or this calendar year — e.g.
/// `45 days in app this year`.
///
/// Promoted from marketplace_sdk's profile footer (it always read only
/// base_sdk symbols) so every SDK's profile footer can reuse it. The
/// year figure comes from the backend `app-usage/stats` endpoint via
/// [AppUsageService]; the week figure prefers a backend-served
/// `days_in_app_this_week` and falls back to the service's local
/// once-per-day counter.
///
/// Which period renders is the app's HOME SDK's choice via the [period]
/// seam; the default is [AppUsagePeriod.year], so apps whose home SDK
/// sets nothing keep the historical year figure. Per-instance
/// [showThisWeek] / [showThisYear] overrides still exist for a caller
/// that must pin a specific composition regardless of the seam.
///
/// SMALL COUNTS render adaptively (per the product ask to show a finer
/// unit "if hours are small before we move to days"): the telemetry lane
/// records at most one `app_open` event per day and no session durations,
/// so true hour figures cannot be derived — the honest sub-day rendering
/// is copy, not arithmetic. `0` reads "Less than a day in app this year"
/// (the user is in the app right now, so a literal "0 days" was always
/// false-feeling) and `1` reads the singular "1 day in app this year";
/// from 2 the plural day figure takes over unchanged.
