/// [AppUsageBadge]. Promoted from marketplace_sdk's profile footer — every
/// piece of it already read only base_sdk symbols.
///
/// Exported on its own (not just inside [BaseProfileFooter]) so an SDK
/// that overrides the `base.footer` section can still embed the standard
/// meta row inside its own composition — marketplace_sdk does exactly
/// that to keep its member-only links above the row.

  /// [AppConnectivity.backendAvailability] can only ever fail there, and
  /// the dot drew a red Offline on every tour still - a connection-failure
  /// state on a build that has no connection to fail, captured verbatim by
  /// the guided tour. Anything [DemoSession.demoActive] covers - the tour
  /// build, or a demo session served from the same fixtures - reads as
  /// connected without probing; a real session still asks the backend. The
  /// probe itself stays honest: the splash boot and `ConnectivityService`
  /// read it to gate the outbox drain and the translation fetch, and must
  /// keep seeing the backend as it is. Same gate the other SDKs put in
