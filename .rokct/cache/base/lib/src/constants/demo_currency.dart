/// The currency every demo amount prints in: South African rand, symbol
/// before the amount ("R1,500.00").
///
/// Every money string in the fleet goes through [AppHelpers.numberFormat],
/// which reads `LocalStorage.getSelectedCurrency()`. A real build fills that
/// from the backend's currency list (`CurrencyNotifier.fetchCurrency`); the
/// tour build talks to no backend, so nothing ever selected one and intl fell
/// through to its locale default - the ISO code as a suffix, "42.50USD" -
/// while every seed fixture in the fleet trades in rand (the demo account is
/// in Sandton with a +27 number, the wallet ledger cashes out to a South
/// African bank, the seeded shops and orders carry ZAR). The seller-side
/// SDKs each seeded this same currency from their own DI; this is the one
/// copy the kernel owns so every composed shell - customer, seller, driver -
/// prints the same money from boot, without each feature SDK repeating it.
///
/// "Demo" here is [DemoSession.demoActive]: the guided-tour build
/// (`--dart-define=TOUR_MODE=true`) or a demo SESSION (a server-marked demo
/// account signed in on a shipped build). Two seams, both inert outside
/// one:
///
/// * [seed] stores [rand] as the selected currency once, only where nothing
///   is selected - so a real currency, or a test harness's own seed, is
///   never overwritten. The request bodies that send `currency_id` / `rate`
///   read the same store. [followDemoSession] runs it from
///   `BaseSdkDependencies.register` and again on every session flip, so a
///   demo account that signs in AFTER boot still prints rand; a flip off
///   writes nothing, so the currency a real account had stays where it was.
/// * [fallback] is what [AppHelpers.numberFormat] consults when the store is
///   still empty, so a demo session can never print the ISO-code suffix even
///   if the store is cleared under it.
