/// change. Registered app-side (rCore hooks) as

/// same key, so which backend answers is decided purely by

/// endpoints is dropped (`paas.api.lms.list_courses` becomes
/// `api.lms.list_courses`); the gateway resolves it against the composed
/// app's own whitelist server-side, so the same SDK code runs against any
/// backend the baseUrl points at.
///
/// Response shape: the shared Dio stack's `FrappeResponseInterceptor`
/// already unwraps the top-level `message` envelope on 2xx, and the
/// gateway returns the target method's own return value inside that same
/// single envelope — so what [tenant] answers is exactly what a direct
/// dotted call answered. Do NOT unwrap `message` again here.
