/// (customer, manager, driver, ...), but the apps disagree about what a
/// successful credential exchange MEANS: the customer apps accept any
/// account and land it on the marketplace, while manager only admits
/// sellers (and drops everyone else back at login), and driver will only
/// admit drivers. That app-specific answer is composition DATA, not code:
/// an SDK's manifest declares a "session_policy" (normally the home SDK,
/// gated under "app_type" so e.g. merchants_sdk can scope it to manager
/// builds), the installer injects it into the installed
/// auth_session_policy.dart shell, and the login flow consults [I] at the
/// points where it used to hard-code the landing.
///
/// The base class IS the default policy — allow every account and land it
/// exactly where auth_sdk always did — `goHome`. Apps whose composition
/// declares no "session_policy" never reassign [I], so they keep today's
/// behavior to the letter. (Demo builds used to branch to the UI-type
/// picker here instead; that picker is gone, so demo lands home too.)
