/// Drives Android's Restore Credentials across the whole session
/// lifecycle, so a user who moves to a new device arrives already signed
/// in instead of at a login screen.
///
/// Google Play requires this of any app supporting sign-in, optional or
/// mandatory, from April 2027, and measures compliance by successful
/// restore key retrieval.
///
/// Four moments matter, and this class owns all four:
///
///   * [ensureRestoreKey] -- after a successful sign-in or registration,
///     and again on a later launch when a session already exists. A cached
///     flag keeps it from re-running on every single login.
///   * [attemptRestore] -- on first launch, and again from the
///     `BackupAgent`'s `onRestoreFinished()` once app data has landed.
///   * [clear] -- on sign-out and on account deletion. Restore keys
///     otherwise survive until uninstall, so failing to call this would
///     sign a departed user back in on their next device.
///
/// Every entry point is safe to call unconditionally: on a platform with
/// no restore-credential support (which is every platform but Android, and
/// Android too until core's channel is installed) they all no-op quietly.
/// Nothing here ever surfaces an error to the user -- a restore that does
/// not happen is invisible, and the ordinary sign-in screen is the
/// fallback.
