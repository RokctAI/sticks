/// onboarding").
///
/// auth_sdk owns only the core account step (credentials, OTP) and the
/// generic pipeline that runs AFTER it succeeds — sequencing, the progress
/// indicator, the skip affordance. Anything domain-specific (Supacharge's
/// school + grade capture, a future app's whatever) arrives as one of
/// these, declared in the contributing SDK's manifest.json
/// "registration_steps" list and injected by sdk_installer_base.py's
/// update_registration_steps() into the installed shell
/// (lib/presentation/routes/registration_step_pages.dart) — so auth_sdk
/// never learns what a school is, exactly as onboarding_sdk never learned
/// what a grade is.
///
/// The [content] widget reaches the flow through [RegistrationStepScope],
/// so a step can advance the pipeline without auth_sdk exposing internals
/// to host code:
///
/// ```dart
/// RegistrationStep(
///   skippable: true,
///   content: Builder(builder: (context) => MyStep(
///     onDone: () => RegistrationStepScope.of(context).next(),
///   )),
/// )
