/// Installed into the composed app's `main()` by auth_sdk's manifest
/// `boot_hooks` entry (`RestoreCredentialGate.install();`), the same way
/// [PendingOtpGate] is. That placement is what makes the two launch-time
/// obligations actually happen without every app shell hand-wiring them:
///
///   * **No session yet** -- try to restore one. This is the "retrieve on
///     first launch" half of Google's guidance, and it is what Play
///     measures as a successful restore key retrieval. On the common
///     launch, where the device holds no restore key, it costs one quiet
///     failed lookup and nothing is shown to the user.
///   * **Session already exists** -- make sure the account has a restore
///     key. This is the "create it on a later launch if the user is
///     already signed in" half, and it is the only thing that covers users
///     who signed in before this feature shipped. A cached flag stops it
///     re-running once it has succeeded.
///
/// The other half of retrieval -- the `BackupAgent`'s
/// `onRestoreFinished()`, which fires once app data has actually landed --
/// belongs to the Android side in core. It re-enters through
/// [restoreAfterBackupRestored], so both entry points end up in the same
/// place. Google is explicit that `onRestore()` is never called for this
/// and only `onRestoreFinished()` is reliable.
///
/// Nothing here can fail loudly. A restore that does not happen is
/// indistinguishable from an ordinary cold start, and the sign-in screen
/// is always the fallback.
