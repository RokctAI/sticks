/// and connectivity regain kick the engine). The switch is read per push,
/// so the handler `AuthSdkDependencies.register` attaches once follows it
/// with no re-registration.
///
/// The engine offers no hold verdict, so a held op counts an attempt and

/// never the ten that park an op. A first-class hold in the engine is the
